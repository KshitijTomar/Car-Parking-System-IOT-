      > Android App (JAVA)
      > Website for On-the-go purposes (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT)
  > Back-End Development
      > PHP & MySQL coding for linking the Android app and website to the database
  > Database for all Car Parking
      > This Database will contain all the data required for the project
